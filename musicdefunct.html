    <h3>old abandoned music projects</h3>
    <p>honestly just putting this here for posterity or whatever</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><a href="https://i-am-a-knife.bandcamp.com/"><strong>i am a knife</strong></a> (2017ish-2021)<br>
    my first and main music project for a long time. i started production under raineymornings, then i changed names to i am a knife. mostly hip hop stuff but i tried (and arguably failed) to branch off into other electronic genres like house. ditched i am a knife because i didnt like my backlog at all, and i needed a fresh start. also i dont fuck with some of my old collaborators and i want distance between me and them.</p>
   <p><a href="https://i-am-a-knife.bandcamp.com/album/not-safe-for-work/"><strong>NSFW?</strong></a> (2018-2019)<br>
duo of me as the producer and my friend kimba kaleidoscope as the rapper. we made 2 eps worth of songs and a bunch of singles. very very embarrassed by the quality of my production on these tracks honestly, but i was still in highschool so whatever</p>
  <p><a href="https://mortuarypiracy.bandcamp.com/album/something-silly"><strong>mortuary piracy</strong></a> (2021)<br>
  one off ep with my friend me.exe. might do another one in the future but nothing is guaranteed so its "defunct" for now.</p>
   <p><a href="https://hearteyesfuneral.bandcamp.com/"><strong>heart eyes funeral</strong></a> (2021-2023)<br>
   i made heart eyes funeral as a continuation of i am a knife. unfortunately, i was not able to maintain the previous output i had, and i stopped making hip hop almost entirely. i abandoned hip hop recently because of a lack
   of passion and disillusionment with the community. up until this year (2023), i always told people i was a producer first and everything else second. that has changed. i would love to go back to making hip hop again one day, but 
   nothing like this.
