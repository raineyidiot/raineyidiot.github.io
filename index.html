	i have a lot of things i want to say and youtube has been an incredible method of getting those ideas into the world. got a few new <a href="art.html">art pieces</a> up as well.</p>
	<br>

	and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIb3cYtHpoQ">many,</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R3fNLmfO7M">many</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNRZuUkhP9Y"> new videos!</a> *probably* gonna
	overhaul the site pretty soon to make it a lil more pleasing to look at, im kinda over this aesthetic right now lol</p>
	<br>
	<p>5/14/23: holy moly we got weekly updates! we got a <a href="https://shittykickflips.dog/art.html">bunch of new art posted!</a> ive had so much fun with the gifs lately, expect more of that stuff.
	i added a guestbook (as you can see above) so please leave a message! i love seeing things strangers think about me and my art :3 also! ill be joining a niche webring with a friend of mine i met recently. 
	were hammering out ideas still, but id love to figure this out and get it set up in a few days! i think webrings are fucking cool! kk, see yall soon with more shitttt</p>
	<br>
	<p>5/9/23: hello everyone! today i have a bunch of stuff to drop again! <a href="https://everythingsucksforever.bandcamp.com/track/diy-guy">new single by ESF out!</a> its about the many terrible awful men
	ive met at house shows. fuck these guys! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywZrxCHzv9Y">i also have a new youtube video out! </a> this one is very fun, i wanted to talk about final fantasy iii and i put more time than 
	i normally do into editing it. <a href="https://shittykickflips.dog/art.html">new piece on the art page.</a> also! "whatever man" is on more or less indefinite hiatus lmao. i know i literally got 1 chapter in, but im the kind of 
	person that struggles to make longform art. im very spur of the moment and impulsive with my art, and writing a whole story takes a lot of time! also, ive been tossing the idea around in my head to post more than
	just my own stuff on this site. i would love to put other people's music and art here too. check out my <a href="https://shittykickflips.dog/contact.html">contact page</a> and let me know if you want anything to be
	posted here, i think it could be really fun to post a bunch of art i like and make it sort of curated. speaking of collaborative art, i actually thought of doing a zine the other day! but i have no idea how to even 
	start to organize that, so maybe ill keep that idea swimming in my head for a little longer. but if you have any interest, hit me up on the contact page! ok, that should be all. see yall soon :)</p>
	<br>
	<p>5/1/23: sorry for lack of updates! i got this Thing where if i'm late on something i avoid all stimulus that reminds me of it. so i tend to neglect many things in my life! lots of things to talk about though. for starters, 
	<a href="https://everythingsucksforever.bandcamp.com/album/soupur-sower-wermz"> new everything sucks forever ep is out!</a> 
	been making lots of youtube videos lately as well, that blogpost i was gonna make about the creation of the album "everything sucks (forever)" turned into 
	<a href="https://youtu.be/Ah_B5y2OkMoturned">this video here.</a> 
	ive updated the <a href="https://shittykickflips.dog/art.html"> art section of the site as well,</a> i feel like ive been making lots of cool self indulgent fursona art lately. 
	<a href="blog8.html">new blogpost</a> about identity out now as well.
	that *should* be everything. back soon with more things!</p>
	<br>
	<p>3/17/23: <a href="https://everythingsucksforever.bandcamp.com/album/everything-sucks-forever">NEW ALBUM BY EVERYTHING SUCKS FOREVER OUT NOW!!!</a> GO LISTEN TO MY ALBUM I WORKED VERY HARD ON IT!!! will be posting a blogpost about the creation of the album this weekend :3</p>

	<br>
	<p>3/5/23: i am not dead! i lost a lil confidence in my album after i relistened a few times, so i'm gonna polish it a some more before release. plus, i got really excited and 
	started a brand new project this past week! i'm writing an online novella(?) [is that what this would be?] about a group of 3 trans women struggling to make human connections with each other. 
	it's titled "Whatever Man." i added a tab for it on this site here under <a href="whatevermanindex.html">"whatever man"</a>. the first chapter <a href="chapter1.html">has been posted,</a> 
	and the character bios <a href="characterbios.html">are available as well.</a> i would love to update frequently but this is just a passion project, no clue how fast i can write lmao.
	<br>
	<p>2/28/23: OOPS album delayed until probably THIS weekend, i have to rerecord a couple verses. <a href="https://theclockwatchers.bandcamp.com/album/covers-recorded-on-my-cassette-player-i-got-off-ebay-for-like-20-bucks">heres a lil ep i made with my bandmate while you wait</a></p>
	<br>
	<p>2/23/23: would ya look at that! i got proper hosting now :D feels good to graduate from neocities. ill be hosting all my music here (as well as bandcamp) as soon as i get more time to work on it. i spent like a billion hours just trying to get this hosting thing going lmao</p>
    <br>
	<p>2/22/23: uh album out this weekend probably. <a href="https://everythingsucksforever.bandcamp.com/track/alex-teen-suicide-cover">heres a lil cover while you wait i guess</a></p>
    <br>
	<p>2/20/23: cleaned up the site a lil more, revamped the art section so it doesnt look terrible, and added a contact page. i was also trying to learn how to do a mail list but holy shit that is hard lmao anyways im working on lots of new music so look forward to an album pretty soon</p>
    <br>
	<p>2/11/23: <a href="blog7.html">new blogpost</a> out. might figure out how to do an email list soon or something so i can notify people when the site updates lmao. also, i made the mobile version of the site less ass to use. its still pretty sloppy but its readable now as opposed to before

    <br>

    <br>
	<p>1/17/23: site revamp: added a navigation bar and generally made site usage far less clunky. added a seperate page for music so i can post recent tracks there and stuff. ideally, ill try to join/make some kind of webring sometime soon so people actually visit this site lolllll. anywayzzzz, <a href="https://everythingsucksforever.bandcamp.com/track/angel">new song by everything sucks forever out now</a></p>
